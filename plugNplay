Create a UDP file on both Master and Slave
 modify Slave's terminal: 
sudo python path/to/foo.py


modify Slave's: 

nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
		

Add at the bottom: @lxterminal
		

This causes that at boot up the terminal is opned
Since inside the terminal we are calling 
our script
 it gets executed at boot up
However, everytime a 
new terminal window is open
that script is called again. and again..

One case will be SSH
